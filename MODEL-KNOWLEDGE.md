# WHAT THE MODELS KNOW — the whats-what reference
*One page per tool: what's IN the model (validated), what was TESTED AND REJECTED
(don't re-argue it — the data spoke), and what the model is BLIND to (your manual
overlay zone — edges you might see that the model cannot). Updated 2026-07-27.*

Rule of thumb when a price looks wrong: first check BLIND SPOTS. If your read lives
there, the model isn't disagreeing with you — it can't see the thing you see.

## MLB — HR board (mlb_hr.py)

**IN (each validated or long-standing):**
batter season line blended with Marcel multi-year talent (age-adjusted, traded-player
stints summed, freshest-of live/snapshot) · season anchor (60% weight ≥60 PA; prior-
anchored below) · park factor (confidence-shrunk, +0.07 logit for low-conf parks) ·
temperature + wind direction vs park orientation · platoon (when handedness known) ·
opposing-starter composite (K/BB/flyball, league-centered; neutral if TBD/small) ·
bullpen HR rate · Savant barrels · bat-vs-pitch-zone heat (demoted weight) · batting-
order slot (PA share + hitter-quality gradient) · HOT HAND: homered in last graded
game = +0.18 logit (only the most recent game carries signal) · monthly recalibration
(leak-free, holdout-gated).

**TESTED & DEAD:** month/season phase · day of week · small-sample pitcher shrink
changes · pitcher residual momentum · recency-weighted calibration · umpire (for K;
never showed for HR context either).

**BLIND SPOTS:** day vs night game · umpire assignment · batter vs-hand splits beyond
the platoon tag · travel/getaway days · lineup changes after build (spot tags flag
rookies/new bats, not scratches) · anything intra-day (board is pregame).

## MLB — K props (mlb_kprops*.py)

**IN:** pitcher season K/BF, league-regressed · expected IP from his ACTUAL STARTS
only (game-log; relief innings excluded — the swingman guard, after Perkins pinned
7.0 IP off bulk-relief innings) · opponent OVERALL team K% shrunk 0.6 toward neutral
(walk-forward validated on 2,448 starts — 0.6 beat the old 0.5 in 3/3 periods) ·
push credit on whole-number lines · stale-slate guard + auto-rebuild when a fresh
slate publishes.

**TESTED & DEAD (all on real 2025 data):** umpire K-tendency · catcher framing ·
recent-form windows · home/away splits · days rest · workload (BF) trend ·
innings shrinkage toward league average (raw start-average won on holdout; shrink
actively hurts short-leash arms — openers really are short).

**BLIND SPOTS:** opponent K% **vs LHP/RHP** (← the Noah Schultz issue; experiment
running to close this — see below) · lineup-specific whiff (who's actually in tonight)
· pitch-type matchups · scratches after build.

## NFL (nfl_model.py)

**IN:** Elo with margin-aware updates · ADAPTIVE home-field (leak-free running
estimate; currently ~34 Elo, down from ~57 in the 2010s — the fixed 48 was a hidden
look-ahead) · rest days (linear) · divisional-game shrink ×0.90 at prediction ·
preseason reversion.

**TESTED & DEAD:** play-by-play EPA + QB-EPA · QB win/loss residual rating · wind,
temperature, dome, surface · Thursday/short-week beyond rest · playoff temperature ·
late-season dead-rubber (favorites actually do BETTER) · bye-week nonlinearity ·
parameter retunes.

**BLIND SPOTS:** who the quarterback actually is (injuries/benchings — the team rating
carries it with a lag) · all injuries · weather as game-total context · market prices
(deliberately excluded; disagreement vs market is the displayed edge).

## Soccer (soccer_model/publish)

**IN:** Dixon-Coles fit on **xG** wherever understat joins (98% of matches — validated:
beats goals-fit 3/3 seasons, holdout Brier +0.0064) with goals fallback · time decay ·
home advantage · rescheduled matches settle within ±45 days · market anchors displayed.

**BLIND SPOTS:** lineups/rotation (biggest one — cup-week squad rotation) · injuries ·
manager changes · promoted teams start near league-average · congestion/fatigue ·
weather.

## UFC — research blend (ufc_blend_predict.py, in live A/B vs production)

**IN:** Elo (K=96) · striking + grappling margin EMAs · control · sub-threat EMA ·
experience & layoff · **AGE from DOB** (validated: −0.0095 Brier, the biggest UFC
finding) · namesake guard (no more 2006 Rick Davis) · A/B graded automatically against
production every card.

**TESTED & DEAD:** reach · finish-aware K updates · opponent-adjusted striking ·
heavyweight-variance myth (HW favorites are RELIABLE; middleweight is the chaos
division) · Abu-Dhabi-judges style regional lean (unmeasured, treat as ±1-2% at most).

**BLIND SPOTS:** short-notice replacements (Guskov-type — huge, manual) · weight-cut /
camp news · suspensions & why (the Temirov TMZ read was yours, not the model's) ·
southpaw/style matchups · round-by-round and method (blend prices win% only).
